# TODO

This file lists the things we'd like to get done.  Some of it is stuff we're working on and some of it is stuff anyone in the community could help with.

## Forever tasks

Things anyone can do across all docs:

* Copy editing - we *always* need folks to review spelling and grammar.
* Review code samples - while we always strive for code samples to be perfect and tested, sometimes they do break.
* Add README.md for all samples and tools with the following information:
  * Name
  * What does the script/tool do

## Doc work in specific areas

### Container docs

* Update all references to Hyper-V containers to be Hyper-V isolation (versus process isolation)
* Containers Work in Progress and Known Issues pages
  * Add exact error messages for more searchable resolution to issues.
* Get started guides for:
  * cri/containerd
  * runhcs
* build a table outlining tradeoffs between Hyper-V isolation and process isolation

### Hyper-V docs

* Hyper-V on Windows [remote host management article](./virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/remote_host_management.md)

### Community docs

## Doc structure and functionality

* Move Hyper-V server to virtualization docs
  *	Consolidate and cross ref where possible to Hyper-V for Win 10.
* Move blog to docs
  * Investigate making a template for a new docs in a file so when people go to add a new blog, it autopopulates the TOC + metadata and such.  Maybe a ‚Äúcreate blog‚Äù button üòä.  I think this is the biggest barrier to blog in docs.
